# Introduction
This repository is a centralised collection of TSQL queries that I have found to be useful. I have gathered these queries in one place as a reference point to refer back to whenever I need them. This allows me to quickly look up and use the queries that I need, rather than having to remember them all.

As I learn new queries, I will add them to this repository so that it can serve as a comprehensive reference point. This will allow me to easily refer back to all of the queries that I have found useful, and it will also allow me to build up a collection of queries that I can use to solve various problems or accomplish various tasks.

By continuously adding to this repository, I hope to create a valuable resource that I can use to streamline my work and increase my productivity.

Feel free to browse through and use any of the queries that you find useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me.
